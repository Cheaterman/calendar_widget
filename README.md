##### New design -- CalendarWidget

We can set `foreground_color` and `background_color`.
- `foreground_color`: ListProperty -- Basically fonts color.
- `background_color`: ListProperty -- Background color.
- `header_color`: ListProperty -- color for the month & year header labels.

Top arrows are considered as images and there sources can be change, with
the following properties:
- `left_arrow_source`: StringProperty -- path for the left arrow.
- `right_arrow_source`: StringProperty -- path for the right arrow.

##### Active date is now a property

`active_date` is now considered as a property to be dispatch correctly.

##### Locale is also a property

`locale` is use to change default system's locale for the widget.

##### New Screenmanager animation

`left` / `right` Screenmanager's animation are now reversed.

##### Better compatibility with Python3

- Temporary re-implemented class TimeEncoding() -- Python3 deprecated,
  to run correctly.
- Then fixing usage of locale for time formatting.
- Uses of .format() methods.
- Shortening and explicinting functions and methods.
- PEP8 Compatible.
